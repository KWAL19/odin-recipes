<h2>Why Honey Glazed Chicken?</h2>
    <p>When I was growing up there was a local grocery store that had chinese available in it and I would go there frequently for one dish. That dish would be honey glazed chicken. It had a great balance of the sweet honey mixed with the red pepper flakes which made the dish a flavor explosion in my mouth. So I had to make a version at home and after much trial and error I found a recipe that hit just right to give me that same sweet and spicy sensation. Please follow the instructions listed below and I hope you enjoy this delicous meal!</p>
