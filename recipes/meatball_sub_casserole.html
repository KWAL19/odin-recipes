<h2>Why Meatball Sub Casserole?</h2>
    <p>When I was a kid one of my staple sandwhiches at Subway was a meatball sub. The way the meatballs blended with the tomato sauce and the cheese made for a super flavorful and delicous sandwhich. I had to find a fun and creative way to bring this sandwhich into a delicious meal at home and alas I found Meatball Sub Casserole. Please follow the instructions below and once complete I am very confident you will be having more than one piece!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen garlic bread</li>
        <li>2 (24 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>40 italian-style frozen meatballs</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Heat garlic bread spread side up on a baking sheet in the oven until golden brown around 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Bring spaghetti sauce to a boil in a large pot. Place frozen meatballs in the sauce. Reduce heat to low and simmer until meatballs are heated through which takes about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Tear garlic bread into bite-size pieces and spread into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour spaghetti sauce and meatballs over garlic bread, coating bread with sauce and distributing meatballs evenly. Spread mozzarella cheese over top in a layer, followed by a layer of Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake casserole until cheese has melted which should take around 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
